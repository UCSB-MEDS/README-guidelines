# MEDS README Guidelines

## Description

General guidelines and best practices for writing informative READMEs. These guidelines are emphasized in [EDS 296 - Data Science Tools for Building Professional Online Portfolios](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/EDS-296-DS-portfolios/), but are meant to be reinforced throughout the MEDS program.

## Contributers

These guidelines were drafted by MEDS staff and faculty [Sam Csik](https://github.com/samanthacsik), [Julien Brun](https://github.com/brunj7), [Carmen Galaz Garcia](https://github.com/carmengg), [Ruth Oliver](https://github.com/ryoliver), and [Max Czapanskiy](https://github.com/FlukeAndFeather), and draw from personal experiences and existing recommendations / standards which are widely adopted by the data science and programming communities.
