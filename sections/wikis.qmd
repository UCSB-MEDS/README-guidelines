## Wikis {#wikis}

While READMEs are used to provide a quick overview of what your project can do, wikis are used to provide additional documentation. From [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis):

>“You can use your repository's wiki to share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how you designed it, or its core principles”

A great way to streamline a repository's README is to move any documentation-style information to a wiki, and then link to the appropriate wiki page from your README. Each wiki page should focus on a single topic.

### Example GitHub repository wikis: 
- [Openscapes website wiki](https://github.com/Openscapes/website-new/wiki), by Openscapes (a user-guide of sorts; notes and conventions for Openscapes website maintainers and contributors) 
- [NCEAS Roundtable (August 2023) workshop materials wiki](https://github.com/samanthacsik/cute-cats-dogs/wiki), by Samantha Csik (setup instructions for workshop participants)
- [`{xaringan}` wiki](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki), by Yihui Xie (includes tips and further customizations that aren't covered in the official R package documentation)
