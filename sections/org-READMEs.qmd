## Organization-level READMEs

**You have the option to add both public (visible to anyone) and private (visible only to organization members) profile READMEs to separately serve each of those communities.** The content you choose to include in an organization profile README is quite flexible, but it's often valuable to add the purpose of the organization, any high-level summary information, and links to important websites / external resources / specific repositories within the organization. **Alternatively (or in addition to), you can update your organization's profile information, including a title and description, as well as relevant links -- these will appear across the top of your organization's landing page.** For example, see [LTER's GitHub organization](https://github.com/lter), which includes both updated profile information *and* a public README:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("images/lter-org.png")
```

## You'll be asked to create an organization-level READMEs for your Capstone work
In [EDS 411 (Capstone Project)](https://bren.ucsb.edu/courses/eds-411b), you'll create a GitHub organization to house all your Capstone-related repositories and code. You'll also be required to include specific information in your organization's README (you'll talk much more about the [required checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10d9-h8UBC1JwZ08MdxI-WJhxfc7DnUolXjgBV1N-pJA/edit) in EDS 411). In the meantime, check out a few examples GitHub organizations and their associated README information.
